Dave was written over the course of two days to include a library of songs from the Homestuck volumes and other albums released on the bandcamp page and used throughout the comic. I also added some funny sound effects I think he would like. If you'd like to request a song be added to his library, send me a message and I'll link you his songlist so you can see what already is in his library. Other songs from the volumes that are not in his library are listed separately and you can just make a comment on the song that you want added.

I am also currently working on bringing youtube video support to Dave. That was my plan initially but as I worked on him it became clear that he'd have to start out as a soundboard for now.

Please do not copy the code. As I mentioned earlier I did spend over 2 days writing the base code and figuring out what the fuck was wrong with his node modules. I write discord bots as a hobby so if you want a custom discord bot, send me a dm and I'll see what I can do.
